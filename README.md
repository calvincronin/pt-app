# Random Timer App

React Native ios app developed with Expo

Set a random looping timer where the lenght between loop iterations is randomly selected between two min/max duration values provided by user. Option to randomize the timer sound.

Purpose is for Physical Therapy, meant for exercises where patient is training to react to random stimuli. For example, wihtout looking at the app, jumping only when prompted by timer, random duration ensures patient doesn't know when next cue is coming.

Random timer noise can be associated with direction or movement, adding another level of subconsious stimuli. For example, jumping when timer goes off, but in a direction associated with each unique time noise.
